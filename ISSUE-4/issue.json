    "summary": "Can GIT integration tests be ran on Travis?",
    "description": "Not sure if this is entirely do-able. You can run custom scripts post-build but would that suffice?\n\nIt needs to use GIT to checkout the build, so we know GIT is there. The question is - can we access it via scripts? If we can then that'd be a big help.",
